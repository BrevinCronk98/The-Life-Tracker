# The Life Tracker 
### By Brevin Cronk

# Overview
## The Life Tracker is my Captstone project for Epicodus. In The Life Tracker, uses will be able to add and delete to multiple different types of lists to help manage the users life. Stretch goals for this project consist of allowing the user to use a MapAPI to find local businesses and restuarants nearby, as well as other user events if they are friends with that specific user. In the end, I want this app to be able to manage nearly all aspects of the users life.

# Description
## The Life Tracker will track and help manage your life and daily activites. You will be able to create grocery lists, to do lists, a goal checklists and more. I plan on implementing maps for the user to use, being able to locate events, resturaunts and businesses user the maps. I want to add someform of a friend data base where a user can add friens, and will then be able to message them, add them to events, and see what they share on their feed.

<summary> Available Scripts</summary>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
